# 3D_Lorenz_Attractor
Just do make to compile. Make sure you have libeigen3.
Renders Lorenz attractor on cpu. Solves with a runge-kutta method. Was a fun exercise.
I plan to re-use most of this code to develop a visualizer for a fully-connected 3d
scanning synthesizer. Thats going to look and sound cool.
